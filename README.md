## hangouts-emoji


the google hangouts emoji set _(size 28x28)_

here's some examples:

![Some examples of the hangouts emoji](http://i.imgur.com/IFWXSHt.png)

covers most of the [the emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for emoji.
the hangouts set does not include the following:

:bowtie:
:metal:
:fu:
:neckbeard:
:feelsgood:
:finnadie:
:goberserk:
:godmode:
:hurtrealbad:
:rage1:
:rage2:
:rage3:
:rage4:
:suspect:
:trollface:
:octocat:
:squirrel:
:shipit:

should be part of the set but currently broken in google hangouts:

:hash:
:zero:
:one:
:two:
:three:
:four:
:five:
:six:
:seven:
:eight:
:nine:

so if you're using something like [emojify](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js) that uses this cheat sheet you will need to include the original emoji instead.
